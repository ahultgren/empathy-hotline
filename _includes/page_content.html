                            Do you wish your therapist or coach were available <em>now</em>, when you’re actually struggling? Would you like to talk about what you're going through when it is actually happening instead of saving it for an appointment next week?
                            <br><br>
                            Often times I don’t need an expert to figure things out for me; I just need someone who listens and understands what I’m experiencing in this moment. I can be that someone for you.

                            Welcome to the Empathy Hotline! Any problem, big or small, seems lighter when understood by someone else. That dreadful application you need to send today can turn into a fun mission. A vague stress and anxiety can become clear and manageable. And to be heard when overwhelmed by a sudden loss or setback can transform despair into a sweet mourning. That’s the magic of empathy.

                            As with any hotline you don’t make an appointment; just call me when you need it, and I’ll be there for you. A session is free (see how this works below) and lasts up to 20 minutes.

                            I am a completely uncertified counselor, mediator, facilitator, gestalt practitioner, coach, and, perhaps first and foremost, human companion. In fact, I like to say “don’t believe anything I say — find out for yourself!” My many years of work on myself is what drives me to want to support others. Having spent a lifetime specializing in shutting down in order to avoid being vulnerable, guessing other people’s expectations, and second-guessing my own intentions, I'm by now fairly experienced in welcoming feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and lack of motivation.

                            I’d like this project to run on a pay-it-forward basis. That is to say, I am able to take your call because others have already paid for your time. After a call you can choose if and how much you’d like to contribute to pay for the next person. I will keep going as long as this chain of giving and receiving stays alive. You may of course also donate without having had a call yourself, simply for the joy of supporting others.
