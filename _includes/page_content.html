                            Do you wish your therapist or coach were available <em>now</em>, when you’re actually struggling? Would you like to talk about what you're going through when it is actually happening instead of saving it for an appointment next week?
                            <br><br>
                            Often times I don’t need an expert to figure things out for me; I just need someone who listens and understands what I’m experiencing in this moment. I can be that someone for you.

                            Welcome to the Empathy Hotline! Any problem, big or small, seems lighter when understood by someone else. That dreadful application you need to send today can turn into a fun mission. A vague stress and anxiety can become clear and manageable. And to be heard when overwhelmed by a sudden loss or setback can transform despair into a sweet mourning. That’s the magic of empathy.

                            As with any hotline you don’t make an appointment; just call me when you need it, and I’ll be there for you. A session is free (see how this works below) and lasts up to 20 minutes. You may call as many times as you want.

                            I am a completely uncertified counselor, mediator, facilitator, gestalt practitioner, coach, and, perhaps first and foremost, human companion. In fact, I like to say “don’t believe anything I say — find out for yourself!” My many years of work on myself is what drives me to want to support others. Having spent a lifetime specializing in shutting down in order to avoid being vulnerable, guessing other people’s expectations, and second-guessing my own intentions, I'm by now fairly experienced in welcoming feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and lack of motivation.

                            At the moment I'm running this project entirely out of my own pocket, simply because I enjoy giving empathy. At the same time my dream is for this project to eventually run on a pay-it-forward basis. That is to say, I wish to feel supported in taking your call for free without asking for anything in return, because others have already sponsored your time. Therefore, after a call you have the possibility to give a donation in order to gift a session to someone else, but <em>only</em> if it's joyful for you to do so. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You may of course also donate without having had a call yourself, if you simply wish to contribute to this chain of freely giving and receiving empathy.
